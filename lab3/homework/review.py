# Remember that there isnâ€™t only one right answer, only good ones :)
#
# 1.
# Why should we use functions at all? + How to define/declare a function?
# a function is a named sequence of statements that belong together.
# Their primary purpose is to help us organize programs into chunks that match how we think about the problem.
# 2.
# How to call/use a function?
# We need a function call. Function calls contain the name of the function being executed followed by a list of values, called arguments,
# which are assigned to the parameters in the function definition
#
# 3.
# What is return, why and how do we use it?
# the return statement causes your function to exit and hand back a value to its caller. The point of functions in general is to take in inputs and return something. The return statement is used when a function is ready to return a value to its caller.
#
# 4.
# Do we have to use return in every function?No
#
# 5.
# What are function arguments/parameters, why and how we use it?
# Function arguments/parameters specify what information, if any, we have to provide in order to use the function. We use it by assigning values to the function parameters when calling the function.
#
# 6. How to use function from a different file other than our currently working file?
# import from another .py file
# for example: from eval (means that it's from the eval.py file)
#
# Note: Function arguments are sometimes also called function parameters
